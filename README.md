# Kindful - Crystal Bytes(Group Project)

This kindful system will be very useful for those who are needy, those who would like to help 
people by donating something and especially when it comes to the hotels and restaurants. 
Since it makes the environment to the donate leftover edible foods to the people it will be a 
benefit for the hotel manages as well and nonprofit organizations like children's home, eldersâ€™ 
home since because organizations will be able to save some food they already have for some 
extent when they are having a rough time.

So, the people who would like to donate things can use this system, through this they can 
identify their exact needs and give a hand to them. On other hand restaurant managers and 
hotel managers can use this system to provide the leftover food to the nonprofit 
organizations, also they will be a part when talking about the users of this system. When it 
comes to the real industry this system will be most suitable for nonprofit organizations apart 
from that to the people who are related to the food industry like hotels, restaurants, bakeries 
etc.
