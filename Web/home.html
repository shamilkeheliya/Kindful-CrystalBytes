            In the present people who are willing to donate foods and other items need to personally visit the organization such as elders’ home and children’s home donate food or another item. Or else they should visit various websites for find locations and their details. We saw lots of hotels large food manufactures waste tons of foods daily. They have search for some places that needs foods. But it is very difficult to identify the places who really need helps. This process takes lot of time to contact the relevant places to check requirements. If that place doesn’t want foods. food donor should find another place. 
            This is very annoying process.
